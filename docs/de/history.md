# The History of SQL ðŸ“œ

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language that has been widely used for managing and manipulating relational databases since the 1970s. 

The development of SQL can be traced back to IBM's [System R project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_R), which aimed to create a relational database management system. In the early 1970s, IBM researcher Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce developed a language called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), which was later renamed to SQL. 

**Timeline of key events in SQL history:**
- 1970s: IBM researchers develop SEQUEL (later renamed to SQL) as part of the [System R project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_R)
- 1980s: SQL becomes an [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute) (American National Standards Institute) standard and later an [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) (International Organization for Standardization) standard
- 1990s: SQL becomes widely adopted as the primary language for interacting with relational databases, due to the rise of the Internet and the increasing need for websites and applications to store and retrieve data
- Today: SQL continues to be widely used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases, supported by a wide range of relational database management systems

## Evolution of SQL Standards ðŸ“œ
SQL standards have been developed and maintained by both American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ANSI published the first SQL standard in 1986, which was then adopted as an ISO standard in 1987. Since then, several new versions of the SQL standard have been released, each adding new features and capabilities. The most recent version is [ISO/IEC 9075:2021 Database languages - SQL](https://www.iso.org/standard/76198.html).

## SQL and Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) ðŸ’»
SQL is the standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS). RDBMS is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in the form of related tables. This allows for easy querying and manipulation of data using SQL. Some examples of popular RDBMS include [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/) and [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

## SQL and the Cloud ðŸŒ¥
With the rise of cloud computing, SQL has also become a popular choice for managing data in cloud-based databases. Many cloud providers, such as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/sql), offer managed SQL databases as a service. This allows developers to easily store and retrieve data without having to manage their own SQL infrastructure.

Overall, SQL has a rich history and has played a major role in the development and evolution of relational databases. ðŸ“ˆ
