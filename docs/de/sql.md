## What is SQL? ðŸ¤”
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to insert, update, and retrieve data from a database. SQL is a standard language that is used by many relational database management systems, including [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/) and [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

SQL is a declarative language, which means that it is used to describe the desired outcome, rather than describing the specific steps needed to achieve that outcome. This makes it a powerful and flexible language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as querying data, inserting and updating records, and creating and modifying tables and other database objects.

SQL is based on the relational model of data, which organizes data into tables, also known as relations, with rows and columns. Each table consists of a set of rows, where each row represents a single record, and a set of columns, where each column represents a specific type of data. This allows for easy querying and manipulation of data using SQL.
