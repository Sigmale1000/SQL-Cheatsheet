# Data and Datatypes in SQL 📊

In SQL, data is stored in tables, where each table is made up of rows (also known as records) and columns (also known as fields). Each column in a table is designed to store a specific type of data, such as text, numbers, or dates. These types of data are referred to as datatypes.

SQL supports several different datatypes, including:
- Numeric data types (e.g. INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL)
- Character and string data types (e.g. CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT)
- Date and time data types (e.g. DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP)
- Binary data types (e.g. BLOB, BINARY)

Each datatype has its own set of associated functions and operators, which can be used to perform various operations on the data.

## Numeric Data Types 🔢
Numeric data types are used to store numeric values, such as integers and decimal numbers. Some examples of numeric data types include INT (for integers), FLOAT (for floating-point numbers), and DECIMAL (for fixed-point numbers).

## Character and String Data Types 💬
Character and string data types are used to store character and text values, such as names and addresses. Some examples of character and string data types include CHAR (for fixed-length strings), VARCHAR (for variable-length strings), and TEXT (for large amounts of text data).

## Date and Time Data Types 🕰️
Date and time data types are used to store date and time values, such as birthdays and appointment times. Some examples of date and time data types include DATE (for storing dates), TIME (for storing times), and TIMESTAMP (for storing both date and time values).

## Binary Data Types 📎
Binary data types are used to store binary data, such as images, audio, and video files. Some examples of binary data types include BLOB (for storing binary large objects) and BINARY (for storing fixed-length binary data).
