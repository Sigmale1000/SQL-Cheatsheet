# Installing SQL, RDBMS, and DBs on Linux üêß

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. In order to use SQL on a Linux machine, you will need to install a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL.

Here are some steps to help you get started with installing SQL and a RDBMS on a Linux machine:

1. Download and install a RDBMS of your choice, such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/).
2. Download and install a SQL client, such as [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/linux/).
3. Once the installation is complete, you can start the SQL client and connect to your RDBMS.
4. You can also use additional tools such as [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) for web-based management of MySQL and MariaDB databases.

## Using Docker for SQL and RDBMS on Linux üê≥
Docker is a popular tool for containerizing applications and services. It can also be used to run a SQL server and RDBMS on a Linux machine. Here are some steps to help you get started with using Docker for SQL and RDBMS on a Linux machine:

1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
2. Search for and download a SQL server and RDBMS Docker image, such as [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) or [PostgreSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
3. Run the downloaded image with the appropriate environment variables and ports exposed.
4. Connect to the running container using a SQL client or web-based management tool.
