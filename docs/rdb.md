# Relational Databases ðŸ“š
A relational database is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in the form of related tables. It is based on the relational model of data, proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. The relational model organizes data into a set of relations, which are similar to tables in a relational database. Each relation consists of a set of rows and columns, where each row represents a single record and each column represents a specific type of data.

## The Structure of Relational Databases ðŸ§±
A relational database is composed of a set of tables, also known as relations, each with a unique name. Each table is made up of rows and columns, where each row represents a single record and each column represents a specific type of data. The columns in a table are also known as attributes or fields, and each column has a unique name and a specific data type.

## The Concept of Primary Key ðŸ”‘
Each table in a relational database has a primary key, which is a unique column or set of columns that can be used to identify a specific record. The primary key is used to establish relationships between tables, also known as referential integrity.

## The Concept of Foreign Key ðŸ”‘
Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables. A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that is used to reference a primary key in another table. This allows for data to be spread across multiple tables while still maintaining consistency and integrity.

## Normalization ðŸ“ˆ
Normalization is the process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. This is achieved by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables, with each table containing a specific set of data.

## SQL and Relational Databases ðŸ’»
SQL is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It is used to insert, update, and retrieve data from a relational database. SQL also supports several data manipulation operations, such as creating and modifying tables, as well as constraints and triggers, which are used to enforce data integrity.

Overall, relational databases are an efficient and powerful way to store, manage and extract insights from data, and SQL is the standard language for interacting with these databases. ðŸ“ˆ
